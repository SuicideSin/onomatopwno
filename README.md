omnibus idioms
--------------

"It is what it is." Filler line used in TV and movie scripts

1. Start with "It is what [some eloquent line of dialog giving insight into
   characters or plot should go here]."
2. Be lazy, tired, or both.
3. Copy "It is."
4. Forgo eloquence by finishing the statement with
   what you just copied.
5. Arrive at, "It is what it is."
6. Go to sleep, probably defeated and full of shame.
7. Saddage. :(

The omnibus idiom is the conceptual inverse of an onomatopwno. Instead
of gracefully creating a new rhythm over an old idiom, it replaces
what could have been original material with a tired catchall.

adjusted onomatopwno
--------------------

"Sherlock Hemlock." Character from 1980s Sesame Street.

1. Start with "Sherlock Holmes"
2. Take the syllable "lock" from the first and write over everything in the
second word after the initial "H" of "Holmes".
3. Small adjustment: replace "H" with "H-e-m".
4. Pwnage?

backformed onomatopwno
----------------------

"Live and Let Live."

1. Start with "Live and Let Live."
2. Let the passage of time provide a James Bond movie and title song called
   "Live and Let Die" which itself becomes an idiom.

5. Overwrite "Die" to arrive at the original idiom, but for different reasons.
6. [Borges-approved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Menard,_Author_of_the_Quixote) pwnage

Fractal Phrases
---------------

"Loop the Loop"

1. Start with "loop."

2. Not an onomatopwno.
3. Reminder to look at my reminder about these...

Potentially onomatopwnos, but too terse to be sure
--------------------------------------------------

"You do you." Maybe it derives from "You do your thing, I'll do mine." Not
sure, though.

Little Ceaser's slogan "Pizza Pizza." Write over "pie" with "pizza"

"Holier than holy." copy "holi" and write over "thou"

"Goody goody." Start with "goody two shoes," copy goody, write over
"two shoes."

poeiamatopoeia
--------------

"Sheep in sheep's clothing." Winston Churchill.

Sound from the end is copied to the beginning.

Speculation: these are less common because starting an idiom with the thing
from the end makes it take longer to recognize the original idiom.
Starting with the exact idiom and copying from the beginning is easier to
recognize.
